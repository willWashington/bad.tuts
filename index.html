                        <p>bad.tuts is a tutorial website created for software noobs by a beginner.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am learning to develop software. I've found throughout my life that I learn better when I teach, so I created this website
                            to teach others as I learn. The hope here is that I learn more by maintaining a project while also teaching other beginners
                            how to build software.
                        </p>                      
                        <p>Another badtuts solution is <a href="kb.badtuts.com">_kb, otherwise known as Underscore KB</a>. Those of you who visit that site
                            may initially think these two sites are the same. While it is true that they look the same, they will not serve the same purpose.
                            This website is for tutorials and how-to articles. _kb is a knowledgebase of elements and syntax broken down in to a less technical
                            language. Here I show you how to use the syntax; there I explain to you how to understand the syntax.
                        </p>                    
                        <p>Eventually, I'd like to have a whole slew of badtuts sites that help everyone understand how to program. This will not only
                            bolster my understanding, but help grow our community as well. I'm even considering throwing in a forum, but I'll have to build
                            that myself to keep in the spirit of this site, so that's a ways away.
                        </p>

                        <h1 class="card-lead">Using this Website</h1>
                        <p>The layout for this website will be exactly what you see here.
                            All of the tutorials will be in a series of cards like this one. Eventually, the nav bar will be full of language sites.
                            On each language site will be a series of cards like these that describe how to manipulate languages in specific ways to accomplish goals.                            
                        </p>

                        <p>Eventually, I want to add a Wiki Mode button that will swap the entire layout for this website into a wiki format.                       
                        </p>
